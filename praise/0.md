Today you woke me up when you didn't have to. You gave me one more year of life. You saved me from all of the sins I have made. You take care of me still. My friend died by you never died. "My God's not dead." You still remember me. You don't forget us and you make us your children. You give me everything I need and take me as your own. You give me shelter when I have none. You give me food when I am hungry. You give me water when I am thirsty. Then you go a step higher and give me a room in Your House, Your Blood and your Flesh so I am never hungry. You never left me. When I was struggling and felt all alone you were at my side taking care of me. You will be there long after me and long before. You are the omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent God I worship.
