Octoprose
=========

Hello. I like to write little poems and prose and scribbles. They tend not to mean anything actually happening in my life because they constantly come from little ideas of how two characters interact. By the way, I have a very strange culture and idea of what is and isn't important. Ex: to me temperature is way more important than grades, being accepted by people who made you change is pointless, you should greet someone in their native language whenever possible, open-mindedness and friends, etc.

p.s. I am never going back to normal non-octo-prefixed repository names.
