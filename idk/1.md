1. I miss watching sunsets.
2. I want to feel happy.
3. I don't want to die alone.
4. We live in a world vivid with beautiful masterpeices of people but I no longer believe I am worthy to be called anyones masterpeice.
5. I am wreck. I was a head on collision.
6. The crisp of air left me dry; and I was hung out to die.
7. The crack of the whip held with your words.
8. As you should know, "The source of all magic is lies."
9. Our magical happiness is all a lie.
10. What does and doesn't exist, I think it would be ever so bliss, if I got a little break.
11. A little stop, just to take a little break.
